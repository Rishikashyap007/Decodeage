                    case. In the simplest sense, growth in most cases is
                    healthy, whereas ageing is mostly a degradation. our cells
                    begin to deteriorate when growth ceases (López-Otín et

                    referred to as their "genome". The literal translation of
                    genomic instability is defined as excessive damage to the
                    genetic material i.e. the DNA, that impairs the normal
                    functioning of the body leading to a paced-up ageing
                    process. The marvellous human body is designed in a way
                    that has various mechanisms that work in an orchestrated
                    manner to instantly repair the damaged DNA. But when a
                    certain threshold is crossed, these repair mechanisms fail
                    to work and favour the ageing process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">(Belancio et al.,

                  lead to cancer, impaired cell function, genetic disorder,
                  developmental abnormalities and age-related disordered.
                  genetic "typos" can cause cancers, impaired cell function,
                  or even cell death.

                  Our genetic material is stored in a condensed structure,
                  called chromosomes. These chromosomes have cap-like
                  construction at the end which are termed “telomeres”.
                  Telomeres consist of repeated DNA sequences. Whenever cell
                  division occurs, the length of a chromosome is reduced by
                  between 25 to 200 bases (A, C, G, or T), and the only
                  portion of the chromosome that is lost, however, is the
                  telomere. This leaves the major portion of the DNA unharmed
                  because the ends of the chromosomes are protected by
                  telomeres. Had it not been for telomeres, the majority of
                  crucial regions of the DNA would be lost every time a cell
                  divides. This would ultimately result in the deletion of
                  whole genes.

                  <span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;As we age, the length of the telomeres shortens and
                    reaches a “critical length” where the chromosome fails to
                    replicate any further. This "critical length" causes the
                    cell to undergo apoptosis, also referred to as programmed
                    cell death. Telomerase is a type of enzyme that aids in
                    the formation of those repeated sequences present in the
                    telomere. The cells of our body lack a high concentration
                    of telomerase as we age and thus enhance the ageing
                    process. This entire phenomenon is termed telomere

                  Epigenetics is the study of how DNA interacts with the
                  plethora of smaller molecules that are located inside of
                  cells that have the ability to activate and deactivate
                  genes.&nbsp; In epigenetics, the changes occur “on” the DNA
                  sequence rather than “in” the sequence as seen in mutation.
                  Despite having essentially the same genomes, each person is
                  distinct because of epigenetics. Epigenetic modifications
                  can enhance or hinder the transmission of specific genes.

                <p style="text-align: left">
                  <span style="font-weight: 400">In simpler terms, epigenetic changes can either silence a
                    gene i.e inhibit its expression by suppressing its
                    transcription, or enhance its transcription by making it
                    more available. All the chemicals that regulate this are
                    collectively called the “epigenome”. DNA-methylation is
                    one of the epigenetics phenomena where the attachment of
                    methyl groups on the DNA renders its transcription.
                    Epigenetics is largely associated with environmental and

                  The IGF-1 and insulin pathway is a way that our body senses
                  nutrients and controls lifespan. This pathway works with
                  other systems that sense things like amino acids and energy
                  levels. Some of these systems work in the opposite way,
                  sensing the breakdown of molecules. Studies have shown that
                  when these pathways are activated, it can lead to healthy
                  ageing.

                  Stem cells are special cells in our body that have the
                  ability to turn into different types of cells and help
                  regenerate or repair damaged tissue. However, as we age, the
                  ends of our chromosomes, called telomeres, can shorten,
                  which causes the stem cells to lose their ability to
                  regenerate and repair as effectively. This can lead to
                  age-related diseases because our body is not able to
                  maintain and repair itself as well.

                <p style="text-align: left">
                  This effect applies to important bodily functions such as
                  blood cell production and immune cell proliferation. When
                  stem cells run out, the body and its tissues start to age.
                  Recent studies suggest that rejuvenation therapies for stem
                  cells might help reverse the effects of ageing and allow
                  them to function better.

                  As we age, both our cells and the surrounding environment
                  change in ways that affect their mechanical properties. For
                  instance, in fibroblast cells, ageing causes a shift from a
                  flexible actin pool to stable stress fibres, which impacts
                  their ability to move and communicate with other cells. In
                  the innate immune system, older neutrophils can cause tissue
                  damage due to changes in signalling pathways that affect
                  their movement. The structure of the cell nucleus is also
                  affected, with destabilisation of the nuclear lamina and
                  chromatin extrusion leading to senescence. Additionally,
                  changes to the extracellular matrix can cause stiffness and
                  loss of elasticity, leading to age-related diseases such as
                  hypertension and diabetes. The study of mechanobiology
                  concerning ageing shows great promise for improving cellular

                  A Brighter Future for Ageing
                </h2>
                <p style="text-align: left">
                  <span style="font-weight: 400">The field of ageing research has come a long way, and our
                    understanding of the ageing process has grown tremendously
                    in recent years. With the identification of the 12
                    hallmarks of ageing and ongoing advancements in scientific
                    research, we stand at the cusp of a new era in our quest
                    to unlock the secrets of ageing. By embracing
                    multidisciplinary approaches, integrating lifestyle and
                    environmental factors, and fostering collaboration across
                    disciplines, we can continue to push the boundaries of our
                    knowledge and work towards a future where healthy ageing
                    is attainable for everyone.</span>

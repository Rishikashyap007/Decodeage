        <h1>The Past and the Present </h1>
        <h4>
            <b>The voyage of Calcium The discovery of AKG, a crucial part of the Krebs 
            cycle that Hans Adolf Krebs first postulated in 1937</b>, marked the beginning 
            of AKG. For all aerobic creatures to generate energy, this cycle is essential. 
            The subsequent combination of calcium and AKG, which has been recognised for its 
            essential role in the human body since antiquity, was a major breakthrough in 
            nutritional research.
        </h4>
    </div>
    <div class="points">
        <h1> Biology and Chemistry</h1>
        <h4>
            Our cells constantly create alpha-ketoglutarate, which is essential to the Krebs 
            cycle and helps produce ATP, the main source of energy for our cells. Alkaline 
            earth metal calcium is necessary for blood clotting, muscle contraction, nerve 
            transmission, and the formation of bones and teeth. The combination of calcium 
            AKG and essential metabolic pathways may enhance the bioavailability of both 
            components when taken as a supplement due to its chelated state.

    <h1>Ca-AKG: What is it?</h1>
        <h4>     
            Calcium Alpha Ketoglutarate, or Ca-AKG, is a substance that is essential to 
            the body's cellular functions. It consists of calcium and alpha-ketoglutaric 
            acid, a crucial step in the Krebs cycle, commonly referred to as the citric 
            acid cycle, which is how our cells produce energy.

        <h1>AKG's Function in Autophagy</h1>
        <h4>
            Autophagy is one of the main processes in which Ca-AKG is involved. The body uses autophagy, to put it simply, to recycle and eliminate damaged or malfunctioning cells and cell components. The general health and functionality of our cells, tissues, and organs depend on this process.

        <h4>
            Autophagy is one of the main processes in which Ca-AKG is involved. The body uses autophagy, to put it simply, to recycle and eliminate damaged or malfunctioning cells and cell components. The general health and functionality of our cells, tissues, and organs depend on this process.
            Our body's capacity for autophagy declines with age. Age-related disorders and faster ageing are associated with this reduction. Ca-AKG can be quite helpful in supporting our body's autophagy process, which is why it is so important.
            
        </h4>
    </div>
    
    <div class="points">
        <h1>The Relationship Between Ca-AKG and Lifespan</h1>
        <h4>
            An extensive body of research has demonstrated a direct correlation between long life and Ca-AKG supplementation. According to one such study that was published in Cell Metabolism, mice that received Ca-AKG supplementation lived 12% longer than mice that did not receive it. Studies on fruit flies and roundworms have also produced encouraging findings, with a 15% increase in fruit fly lifespans and a 50% increase in roundworm lifespans.
            The important longevity gain is thought to be caused by Ca-AKG's involvement in inducing autophagy and its effects on cellular health and function in general.
        </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="points">
        <h1>Ca-AKG's Function in Cellular Energy Balance</h1>
        <h4>
            Apart from its function in autophagy, Ca-AKG also triggers the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that is essential for preserving the equilibrium of energy within cells. This protein ensures that our cells have enough energy to do their many tasks by monitoring and controlling the energy levels in our cells.
            Ca-AKG can promote good blood sugar regulation and energy balance, both of which are critical for general health and directly affect ageing, by activating AMPK.  </h4>

        <h1>Ca-AKG serves as an antioxidant as well.</h1>
        <h4>
            The antioxidant qualities of Ca-AKG are still another important advantage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other toxic substances build up under conditions of oxidative stress, which is known to cause cellular damage and ageing. Ca-AKG neutralises ROS and may slow down aging-related processes as an antioxidant. 
            Furthermore, Ca-AKG is a precursor to glutamate, which is necessary for the body to produce glutathione, a powerful antioxidant. Ca-AKG strengthens the body's defences against oxidative damage by promoting the synthesis of this antioxidant.

        <h4>
            Our bone and muscle strength inevitably deteriorates with age. Because it 
            facilitates the synthesis of collagen, an essential protein for these tissues, 
            calcium-AKG can support the maintenance of bone and muscle health. Our muscles, 
            skin, and bones are supported and given structure by collagen, which keeps them 
            robust and healthy.

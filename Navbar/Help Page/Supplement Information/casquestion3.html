        <h1>How It Is Consumed</h1>
        <h4>     
            Unless your doctor instructs you otherwise, take 1 capsule in the morning after 
            lunch or breakfast. Even though using our capsules is safe, it's still vital to pay 
            attention to how your body reacts. Should you encounter any negative effects, please 
            stop using the product and speak with your physician. For optimal outcomes, we also 
            advise keeping an active lifestyle and a healthy diet. Our pills are designed to 
            support, not to replace, a healthy lifestyle.

    <h1>For whom should Ca-AKG be avoided?</h1>
        <h4>
            When calcium channel blockers are taken concurrently with Ca-AKG, there may be 
            interactions that reduce the medication's capacity to effectively treat heart and 
            blood pressure disorders. If you are using calcium channel blocks or already have 
            renal problems, stay away from taking Ca-AKG. If you have a history of bleeding 
            disorders, are taking blood thinners, are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, speak 
            with your doctor before using this supplement.

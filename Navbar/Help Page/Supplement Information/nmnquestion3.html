        <h1>Why Choose Decode Age NMN Uthever and not Normal NMN?</h1>

        <h3><b>1. FDA-Recognized Raw Material:</b> </h3>
            <h4>The FDA has approved nicotinamide riboside (NR) as a safe raw material for use in Uthever¬Æ products.
             This guarantees the product's safety and quality right from the manufacturer.</h4>
        
        <h3><b>2. Advanced Manufacturing Process:</b> </h3><h4>
                 Strict production requirements are followed by EffePharm. From procurement to sales, every stage of the NMN raw material 
                manufacturing is painstakingly documented and observed to guarantee quality control.
        </h4>
        <h3><b>3. Production that respects the environment:</b></h3><h4> Uthever¬Æ is made by 
        enzymatic biosynthesis using a biological enzyme that was invented by the company itself. 
        This ensures excellent conversion rates and selectivity. In addition to ensuring
        product safety and quality, this procedure reduces emissions of pollutants.</h4>
        
        <h3><b>4.Assurance of Purity and Authenticity:  </b></h3>
        <h4>NMR and LC-MS testing are used to confirm the purity level of Uthever¬Æ NMN, which is 
            at least 99%.Furthermore, the physiologically active Œ≤-type NMN has been confirmed.</h4>
        <h3><b>5. Third-Party Quality Testing:</b></h3>
        <h4>Strict self-inspection and independent testing are conducted on every batch of 
            Uthever¬Æ. Cooperation with globally renowned organisations like as Micro Quality Las,
             Summit Labs, and Intertek guarantees that the highest quality standards are
              continuously met.</h4>
        <h3><b>Œ≤-NMN : The Form That Is Biologically Active:</b></h3>
        <h4> There are two types of NMN: Œ±-type and Œ≤-type stereoisomers.
             It is noteworthy that the only NMN with biological action is the Œ≤-type.
              This indicates that this particular isomer is required for NMN supplements to
               be effective. Because it actively contributes to the conversion process to 
               NAD+, Œ≤-NMN is necessary in supplements meant to increase the body's levels
                of NAD+.</h4>
        <h3>With the support of rigorous quality control procedures and scientific proof,
             these characteristics
             establish Uthever¬Æ as a dependable and efficient option for NMN supplements.</h3>

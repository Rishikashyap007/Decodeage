        <h1>Comprehending Biological Ageing</h1>
        <h4>          
            It is crucial to comprehend the idea of biological ageing in order to 
            comprehend how Ca-AKG reduces biological age. In contrast to chronological 
            age, which just shows the passage of time, biological age shows how an 
            organism's tissues and cells are functioning. Numerous variables, such as 
            oxidative stress, DNA damage, and cellular malfunction, all play a role in 
            biological ageing and contribute to the progressive deterioration of 
            physiological performance over time.

        <h1>Ca-AKG and Biological Age: Its Impact</h1>
        <h4>
            The purpose of the study was to determine whether Rejuvant, a natural 
            mocktail that contains calcium alpha-ketoglutarate (Ca-AKG) and vitamins 
            that are particular to each sex, may help prevent biological ageing in people. 
            Utilising DNA methylation (DNAm) clocks as a dependable indicator of ageing, 
            the research endeavoured to evaluate the influence of Rejuvant supplementation 
            on the regeneration of biological age.
        </h4>
        <h4>
            42 participants were enrolled in the study design, and they took Rejuvant‚Äîwhich 
            contains vitamins and AKG‚Äîfor an average of seven months. DNAm analysis was done 
            to track changes in biological age both before and after revitalise 
            supplementation.The individuals' biological ageing was reduced by an average 
            of 8 years, according to the persuasive data. This reduction indicates a 
            noteworthy reversal or delay in the ageing process, suggesting that Rejuvant 
            may be effective in fostering youth and energy.
            In addition, this study found that those who were older both physiologically 
            and chronologically benefited more from Rejuvant. According to this research, 
            people who are experiencing advanced stages of ageing may benefit especially 
            from taking Ca-AKG supplements (Demidenko et al., 2021).

    <h1>In summary</h1>
        <h4>
            To sum up, Ca-AKG is a revolutionary development in the field of anti-aging 
            research, providing a viable approach to slowing down biological ageing and 
            encouraging healthy ageing. Through its targeting of important molecular 
            pathways associated with ageing processes, Ca-AKG has the potential to improve 
            health, prolong life, and improve people's quality of life all around the world.

            and vitamins, showed an average 8-year reduction in biological ageing after an

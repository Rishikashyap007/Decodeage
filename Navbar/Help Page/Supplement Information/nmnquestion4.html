        <h1>'beta' Nicotinamide Mononucleotide: Why is it used?</h1>
        <h4>A nucleotide known as nicotinamide mononucleotide, or NMN, is commonly required 
            for the metabolism of cellular energy. Moreover, it directly precedes nicotinamide
             adenine dinucleotide, or NAD+, which is involved in controlling cell function.

            The two stereo isomers of NMN are Œ±-type and Œ≤-type. It is noteworthy that the
             only NMN with biological action is the Œ≤-type. This indicates that this 
             particular isomer is required for NMN supplements to be effective. Because 
             Œ≤-NMN actively contributes to the conversion process to NAD+, it is necessary 
             in supplements meant to increase the body's levels of NAD+.
             As we age, increased mitochondrial energy generation is beneficial and is 
             dependent on higher NAD+ levels. Elevated NAD+ levels also contribute to the 
             preservation and enhancement of mitochondrial health and function, which boosts 
             metabolism and increases fat burning. Finally, NAD+'s role as a co-factor that 
             initiates DNA repair is linked to its anti-aging properties. 
             For extended periods of time, cellular health depends on the repair of damaged 
             DNA.
             Therefore, the Œ≤-type NMN contributes to increased NAD+ levels, which enhance 
             mitochondrial health, DNA repair, and energy generation. Make sure the NMN 
             supplement you choose solely contains the Œ≤-type NMN by carefully reading the 
             ingredients list.

        <h3>Distinctions Among NMN Isomers</h3>
        <ul><li><b>Œ±-NMN:</b> Despite having a similar structure, Œ±-NMN is devoid of the biological 
            activity required for the production of NAD+. 
            Consequently, it does not support the same cellular processes as Œ≤-NMN.</li>
        <br><li><b>Œ≤-NMN:</b>The active isomer that directly helps to raising NAD+ levels is called Œ≤-NMN. 
            Supplements that include Œ≤-NMN are more
            efficient at promoting general health, energy production, and cellular processes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Decode Age Supplements Prefer Œ≤-NMN</h3>
        <ul><li><b> Effectiveness: </b>NAD+ is essential for 
            cellular energy and general health, and Œ≤-NMN is effective in raising NAD+ levels.</li>
        <br><li><b>Targeted Action:</b> Œ≤-NMN supports 
            NAD+-dependent cellular processes more effectively since it is the active form.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>In conclusion ...</h3><h4> although NMN is a useful molecule overall, the Œ≤-NMN isomer is the 
        more desirable option when it comes to NMN supplementation because it is biologically 
        active and efficient in NAD+ production. In addition to supporting healthy NAD+ synthesis 
        and helping to restore normal NAD+ levels, NMN may help extend life and fend off 
        age-related alterations. Still, 
        it's crucial to consult a physician prior to beginning NMN supplementation.</h4>

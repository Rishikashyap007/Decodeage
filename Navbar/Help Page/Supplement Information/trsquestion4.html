    <h4>Two naturally occurring substances that can be found in plants and are well-known for their health advantages are trans- and resveratrol. These substances are frequently taken as supplements or through specific foods like peanuts, blueberries, and grapes. There are a few significant distinctions between resveratrol and trans-resveratrol, despite the fact that both have similar health benefits.
    </h4>
    <div class="points">
        <h1>The Ability to Get Through the Blood-Brain Barrier</h1>
        <h4>Trans-resveratrol's capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier is one of its main benefits. The flow of chemicals from the blood to the brain is governed by this strictly regulated barrier. Because trans-resveratrol may pass over this barrier, it can provide extra defence to brain cells against deterioration and injury, which may lower the chance of developing conditions like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.
            However, trans-resveratrol has been shown to have a greater effect on degenerative illnesses of the brain, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Resveratrol, on the other hand, has been recognised to have anti-aging qualities. Trans-resveratrol is a viable treatment option because studies have demonstrated that it can slow the progression of some disorders.
        </h4>
    </div>
    <div class="points">
        <h1>Greater Antioxidant Capabilities</h1>
        <h4>
            Resveratrol and trans-resveratrol are both strong 
            antioxidants that can aid in warding off free radicals that can harm cells 
            and be a factor in a number of illnesses. Nevertheless, it has been 
            discovered that trans-resveratrol possesses more potent 
            antioxidant qualities, rendering it a more potent combatant of oxidative stress.
        </h4>
    </div>
    <div class="points">
        <h1>Oxidative stress: What is it?</h1>
        <h4>
            When the body's levels of antioxidants and free radicals are out of balance, oxidative 
            stress develops. Free radicals are unstable chemicals that have the potential to harm 
            cells, speeding up ageing and causing a host of illnesses. Resveratrol has the ability 
            to counteract free radicals, which may slow down ageing and lessen its impact on the body.   </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="points">
    <h1>How Beneficial Resveratrol Is</h1>
        <h4>
            According to studies, resveratrol can aid in the body's defence against oxidative stress. 
            This preventive effect is especially important for age-related illnesses since oxidative 
            stress plays a major role in the development of neurological diseases like Alzheimer's. 
            Resveratrol can assist maintain cognitive function and possibly lower the 
            likelihood of cognitive decline as we age by limiting the accumulation of free radicals.</h4>
        </div>

    <div class="points">
        <h1> Enhanced Heart Health</h1>
        <h4>
            Our cardiovascular health also tends to deteriorate with age. On the other hand, 
            it has been discovered that resveratrol significantly improves heart health. 
            Research has demonstrated that it can enhance blood vessel function, lower blood 
            clotting, and assist control cholesterol levels. In doing so, it can lessen the 
            likelihood of heart disease and stroke, two prominent hazards linked to ageing.       
        </h4>
    </div>

    <div class="points">
        <h1>Anti-Inflammatory Characteristics</h1>
        <h4>
            Another prevalent factor that can accelerate ageing and age-related disorders is 
            chronic inflammation. Because heart disease and arthritis are two ailments that 
            are increasingly common as people age, resveratrol's anti-inflammatory qualities 
            may help prevent them.</h4>
    </div>
    
    <div class="points">
        <h1>Impacting the Ageing Mechanism at the Cellular Level</h1>
        <h4>
            Resveratrol may slow down ageing at the cellular level via modifying sirtuin 
            activity. A class of proteins known as sirtuins is involved in the longevity 
            and health of cells. They are involved in metabolic regulation, gene expression, 
            and DNA repair‚Äîall processes that are essential to the ageing process.
        </h4>
    </div>
    <div class="points">
        <h1>Supporting the Hormone Balance</h1>
        <h4>
            One important part of ageing is hormonal changes, and resveratrol may 
            play a part in hormone regulation. Research has indicated that it could have an 
            effect on the body's hormonal balance as we age by perhaps raising testosterone 
            levels and lowering oestrogen levels.
        </h4>
    </div>
    
    <div class="points">
        <h1>In summary</h1>
        <h4>
            All things considered, resveratrol and trans-resveratrol have several health 
            advantages, including enhanced cardiovascular health, cell protection, and 
            anti-inflammatory qualities. On the other hand, trans-resveratrol might have 
            some special benefits, such its higher antioxidant capacity and its capacity 
            to cross the blood-brain barrier. Because these substances may have a beneficial 
            effect on your health as you age, it is worthwhile to think about include them 
            in your diet or as supplements.

    </h4>
    <div class="points">
        <h1>Is It Safe to Supplement With Spermidine?</h1>
        <h4>
            Indeed, spermidine is a naturally occurring substance in the human body. Taking 
            supplements containing spermidine may have favourable effects on various aspects of 
            health, including ageing in a healthy manner. However, it's best to speak with a 
            healthcare provider before incorporating it into your routine. Additionally, its usage 
            should be avoided by those who are nursing or pregnant.

        <h4>
            For most people, spermidine is usually regarded as safe. It is a substance 
            that is found naturally in the body and is essential to autophagy. But like any 
            supplement, there are a few things to keep in mind: 
        </h4>
        <h3><b>1.  Health Conditions:</b> </h3>
            <h4> Before beginning Spermidine, it is imperative that you speak with a healthcare professional if you use medication or have any underlying medical conditions.</h4>
        <h3><b>2.   Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:</b> </h3>
        <h4>
            Little is known about the effects of spermidine on these processes. Supplementing with spermidine should be avoided at these times.</h4>
        <h3><b>3. Age Factor:</b></h3>
        <h4>  Spermidine's anti-aging properties are the main focus of research. Before using, young people, especially those under the age of 18, should speak with a healthcare professional.

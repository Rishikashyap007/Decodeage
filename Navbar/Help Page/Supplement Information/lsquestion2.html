    <h4>It's critical to figure out the right dosage if you plan to use LongeVit pills in your regimen. Here are a few quick tips to get you started in making an informed choice:
    </h4>
        <div class="points">
        <h1>Why People Over 40 Benefit Most from This Combination:</h1>

        <h3><b>1. TEnhanced NAD+ Boosting:</b> </h3>
            <h4> NMN 500, which is a component of LongeVit, makes sure that your body gets enough NAD+, which is necessary for cellular repair, energy production, and general health.</h4>
        
        <h3><b>2.  Synergistic Holistic Health Support:</b> </h3><h4>
            LongeVit has Œ≤ NMN in its composition, but in a low dose of 200 mg. You may ensure that your cells and body functions have a stronger support system by adding an extra 500 mg of NMN to your supplements.</h4>
        <h3><b>3. Targeted Ageing Approach:</b></h3><h4> LongeVit tackles a range of aging-related issues, including cardiovascular support, skin and joint health, and cognitive health. This strategy is far more effective when paired with NMN 500, offering a comprehensive response to the problems associated with ageing.</h4>
        <h3><b>4. The Ideal Dosage for Fully Grown Adults: </b> </h3><h4>
           LongeVit and NMN 500 together provide a balanced and efficient approach to managing ageing, catered to the unique requirements of persons over 40.

        <h1>Is LongeVit Allowed?</h1>
        <h4>For most people, LongeVit is usually regarded as safe. But like any supplement, there are a few things to keep in mind: </h4>
    <h3>Distinctions Among NMN Isomers</h3>
        <ul><li><b>Health disorders:</b>
            Before beginning LongeVit, it is imperative that you speak with a healthcare 
            professional if you have any underlying medical disorders or kidney-related 
            problems because it contains Ca-AKG.</li>
        <br><li><b>Pregnancy and Nursing: </b>The effects of LongeVit during pregnancy 
            and nursing have not been thoroughly studied. During these times, LongeVit 
            supplementation should be avoided.</li>
        <br><li><b>Factor of Age: </b>LongeVit's anti-aging properties are the main focus 
            of research. Before using, young people, especially those under the age of 18, 
            should speak with a healthcare professional.</li>
        </ul>

            <h1>Who Needs to Use Our Extended-Vit Supplement?</h1>
            <h4>For individuals looking for a more all-encompassing approach to ageing, LongeVit is clearly a better option. Its carefully chosen, scientifically supported combination, user-friendliness, and appropriateness for beginners make it a great substitute for NMN supplements. Never forget to get medical advice before beginning a new supplement regimen, particularly if you are using other medications or have pre-existing health issues. You may be confident in your strategy for improving general wellbeing and managing ageing with LongeVit.

        </div>
        <div class="points">
            <h1>Which is better for someone with kidney problems: NMN or LongeVit?</h1>
            <h4>It is advised to choose NMN over LongeVit if a person with kidney problems is using calcium channel blockers, as LongeVit's Ca-AKG component may raise concerns.</h4>
        </div>
    <div class="points">
        <h1>When is the ideal time to take the supplement called LongeVit?</h1>
        <h4>The LongeVit Supplement is best taken in the morning with your first meal of the day. Because LongeVit includes NMN and may alter your circadian rhythm (sleep cycle), be sure to avoid taking it after 3 PM.
        </h4>
    </div>
    <div class="points">
        <h1>In summary</h1>
        <h4>LongeVit is a great option for people looking for a holistic approach to ageing because of its user-friendly design, carefully chosen combination, and suitable for beginners. Before beginning any new supplement, always get medical advice, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions, worries about your kidneys, or are on other drugs. You may improve your general well-being and confidently treat nine out of the fourteen signs of ageing with LongeVit.

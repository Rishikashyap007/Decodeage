    <p class="p10">To start the refund process, log into your account, choose the appropriate order, and then click "Request Refund." Make sure your item satisfies our return policy requirements, which include returning it in its original condition within the allotted time frame, before proceeding. <br>You have to meet the following requirements in order to be qualified for a refund: <br>You can go to the 'Request Refund' page and fill out the form once you are certain that you have complied with these requirements.</p>
    <p class="p9">Payment Gateway Refunds</p>
    <p class="p10">Since we know that receiving a refund can be annoying, we make every effort to make it simpler for you by returning the money to the identical payment method that you originally used. This keeps the return procedure uniform and simple to comprehend.</p>
    <p class="p9">Refund Timing</p>
    <p class="p10">Refunds are often handled seven to ten business days after the returned item is received. A confirmation email should be sent to you as soon as your monies are returned to you. <br>It's crucial to maintain a note of the details of your return and to keep an eye on the amount of your refund on your credit card bill. To start a refund inquiry if you do not see the refund there, get in touch with customer service. <br>In the event that you need assistance, we are always available. We can be reached by phone, email, or chat. </p>

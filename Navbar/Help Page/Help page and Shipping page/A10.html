    <p class="p9">Domestic Delivery Times</p>    
    <p class="p10">We strive to ship your things the same day when you place an order with us by 12:00 pm Eastern time on a weekday. This implies that your order will normally reach you in five business days for our Indian customers. While delays do occur, they are typically caused by events outside of our control, such as delays in overseas orders processing at customs.</p>
    <p class="p9">International Shipping Schedules</p>
    <p class="p10">With a delivery window of up to 4-6 weeks, we broaden our reach internationally for our customers. Although we are aware that there will be a wait, we promise to make sure your things pass customs and arrive at your location undamaged.</p>
    <p class="p9">Handling Delays and Customs</p>
    <p class="p10">We are here to assist you in navigating any unexpected delays that may arise. You may be confident that we'll work tirelessly behind the scenes to expedite the delivery of your things to you in the event that problems with customs and clearance occur. As the shipment process progresses, we consistently advise our customers to verify the status of their orders. Just log in to your account and examine your order history to keep track of your orders. Please use our contact page or live chat feature to get in touch with our customer service staff if you have any more questions concerning delivery schedules or delays. </p>

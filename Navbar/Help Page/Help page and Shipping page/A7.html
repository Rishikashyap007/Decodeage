    <p class="p9">Changing Your Shipping Address <br><br>Steps to Change Shipping Address</p>    
    <p class="p10">It's simple to modify your shipping address. All you have to do is do a few actions. You will be able to change the "Ship To" address during checkout, regardless of the address that appears as default on your profile. <br>Hover your cursor above 'My Account' and choose 'Orders & Settings' to modify your default delivery address. Select the 'Edit' button next to 'Your Addresses' on the Orders & Settings page. All of your stored addresses will be visible in a new window that opens as a result. You can input a new address or choose from one of your stored addresses in this window. Click 'Save' when you've made your new address final.</p>
    <p class="p9">Shipping to Multiple Addresses </p>
    <p class="p10">If you need to send gifts or split your order between home and office, our checkout process allows you to ship items to different addresses quickly and easily. When you are on the checkout page, simply enter the new shipping address in the 'Ship To' address field. If you'd like to save the address for future shipments, make sure to check the 'Save this Address For Later' box.</p>
    <p class="p9">Profile Address vs. Shipping Address </p>
    <p class="p10">The shipping address is where your things will be delivered, and your profile address is how we will get in touch with you. These could be two distinct places. Use the following procedures to manage this in your account settings:  <br>Please don't hesitate to contact us for more assistance if you have any queries or problems.</p>

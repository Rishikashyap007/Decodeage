        What is NAD +
  <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
</button>
    <div class="pannel1">
        <p>
            All live cells contain the essential coenzyme NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), which is necessary for DNA repair, energy consumption, and cellular aging.
        </p>

<div class="faq1">
    <button class="accordion">
        What does NMN stand for
  <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
</button>
    <div class="pannel1">
        <p>
            Nicotinamide Mononucleotide, or NMN, is a precursor of NAD+ that the body uses to increase NAD+ levels.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="faq1">
    <button class="accordion">
        What is the connection between NAD+ and NMN ?
  <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
</button>
    <div class="pannel1">
        <p>
            NAD+ is preceded by NMN. Our bodies use NMN to convert it into NAD+ when it is eaten, which helps to increase the naturally lowering levels of NAD+. </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="faq1">
    <button class="accordion">
        Why do NAD+ levels decline with age
  <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
</button>
    <div class="pannel1">
        <p>
            Age-related decreases in NAD+ levels are caused by oxidative stress, DNA damage, and lifestyle choices. Numerous biological processes may be impacted by this reduction. </p>
    </div>

<div class="faq1">
    <button class="accordion">
        What are the possible advantages of using NMN to raise NAD+ levels?
  <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>
</button>
    <div class="pannel1">
        <p>
            Increasing NAD+ levels with NMN may help manage weight, promote a healthier metabolism, reduce aging, enhance memory and cognition, and fight fatigue. </p>

            <h2>Let us discuss about NAD+, an unsung hero in our bodies. Our cells just cannot survive without it. Although NAD+ plays a vital part in our lives, it is sadly a finite resource that is exhausted by everyday pressures and aging itself.<br><br>                Our NAD+ levels begin to decline as soon as we are born because our cells are using it up. Around the age of 30, this decline may begin to accelerate. We can see a 65% drop in NAD+ levels once we reach the age of 70.<br><br> For self-healing,
                cells under oxidative and metabolic stress mostly depend on NAD+. Furthermore, NAD+ is necessary for all of our cells to generate the energy required for them to perform their tasks.<br><br> Eventually, NAD+ would run out even in the case
                of an entirely stress-free environment. This deterioration was thought to be an inevitable aspect of aging until recently.<br><br> But that's not how things are today. Watch this space to find out how we can get involved in this process.</h2>

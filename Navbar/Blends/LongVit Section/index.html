                    This power duo works to reignite the vitality within your cells. NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide), a precursor to NAD+, and CoQ10 (Coenzyme Q10) support your cellular metabolism. This partnership not only energizes you but also slows cellular ageing,
                    helping you feel youthful and active.

                    These three safeguard your mental well-being as you get older. NAD+ is necessary for optimal brain function, and NMN raises it while curcumin and pterostilbene have neuroprotective qualities. When combined, they support memory and mental flexibility,
                    which are essential components of aging well.

                <p>
                    Traditional medicine has utilized ginseng to treat a few menopausal symptoms. A drop in estrogen levels during menopause can result in a number of symptoms. As NMN increases NAD+ levels, a coenzyme involved in many cellular functions, it may be able to
                    improve cell function and lessen some of the symptoms associated with menopause.

                    Both NMN and CoQ10 are essential for improving metabolic function, which may help with the treatment of diseases like type 2 diabetes. NAD+ is essential for several metabolic functions, including as the energy-producing breakdown of foods. LongeVit may
                    assist in preserving a healthy metabolism as we age by boosting NAD+ levels.
